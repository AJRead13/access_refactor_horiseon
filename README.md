# access_refactor_horiseon
## Description
- The scope of the refactor is to make the site more accessible and to clean up the code in the background to make it easier for new devs to modify.
- I have built this project to showcase my abilities to stream line existing pages and to increase accessibility for other users
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- I have learned how to align html elements with CSS after clearing out and refactoring the code.
